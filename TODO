features:
	selection
	ui mouse select

technical debt:
	drawing loop, char by char
	variable names are horrid, see http://doc.cat-v.org/bell_labs/pikestyle
	maintaining buf->end on backspace (across lines)
	cursor movement off screen should adjust visible sections
	holding shift with backspace,space or enter should still do that action
	bindings now (after nex input handling) has to take shift into account twice, once in mods (|SHIFT) and once in key (XK_Q instead of XK_q) (NB: there is always 32 difference between UC nad LC, could check for ShiftMask in mods and check value of keys, and silently convert)

consider:
	see tour.golang.org for a nice editor, when pasting the text is set to have the same indentation as the surrounding code.
	'highest vo' see how vim does moving by line, it will return to vo even if we visit a line with len < vo before it
	'matching bracket'
	'matching scope' (show the brackets that encloses your current scope)
	inserting line above/below current and positioning cursor there (sublime uses C+enter and C+S+enter)

bugs:
	opening a terminal over (monocle mode) and then closing the term (ctrl-d) causes a blank window to be drawn, win-k twice fixes this
	uppercase doesnt work (shift breaks shit)


the dep graph for this project is as follows:

	ui
	 |\
	 | \
	 |  v
	 |  ark
	 |   |
	 v   v
	llist

that is to say that ui makes call to ark and llist, and ark makes calls to llist. llist can call no-one.  
NB: ui includes both ark and llist  
NB: ark includes both llist and ui  
NB: llist can see neither ui nor ark
