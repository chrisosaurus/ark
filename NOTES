llist functions have to be wrapped by ark functions in order to be callable by ui.
This is because the llist code does not (and should not) include the ui code.


the dep graph for this project is as follows:

	ui
	 |\
	 | \
	 |  v
	 |  ark
	 |   |
	 v   v
	llist

that is to say that ui makes call to ark and llist, and ark makes calls to llist. llist can call no-one.  
NB: ui includes both ark and llist  
NB: ark includes both llist and ui  
NB: llist can see neither ui nor ark  


llist.h and .c define a linked list, this is purely a model
ark.h and .c define the editor, it's commands, main functions, setup and teardown
ui.h and .c define the mainloop, command bindings, and event handlers
