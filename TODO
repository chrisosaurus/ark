features:
	selection
	ui mouse select

technical debt:
	drawing loop, char by char
	long member variable names
	maintaining buf->end on backspace (across lines)
	cursor movement off screen should adjust visible sections
	holding shift with backspace,space or enter should still do that action

consider:
	see tour.golang.org for a nice editor, when pasting the text is set to have the same indentation as the surrounding code.
	'highest vo' see how vim does moving by line, it will return to vo even if we visit a line with len < vo
	'matching bracket'
	'matching scope' (show the bracket that encloses your current scope)
	inserting line above/below current and positioning cursor there (sublime uses C+enter and C+S+enter)
