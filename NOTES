llist functions have to be wrapped by ark functions in order to be callable by ui.
This is because the llist code does not (and should not) include the ui code.


the dep graph for this project is as follows:

	ui
	 |\
	 | \
	 |  v
	 |  ark
	 |   |
	 v   v
	llist

that is to say that ui makes call to ark and llist, and ark makes calls to llist. llist can call no-one.  
NB: ui includes both ark and llist  
NB: ark includes both llist and ui  
NB: llist can see neither ui nor ark  


llist.h and .c define a linked list, this is purely a model
ark.h and .c define the editor, it's commands, main functions, setup and teardown
ui.h and .c define the mainloop, command bindings, and event handlers

========
ark.[ch]     internal functions operating on buffers
bindings.h   user key/mouse binding config
buffer.[ch]  a view onto a file, a set of lines & spans.
config.h     general user config
line.[ch]    a llist of char *, len and cap
llist.[ch]   a generic linked list
main.c       main loop
span.[ch]    llist of styles, referring to lines
styles.h     user style config
ui.[ch]      user interface components

goal dep graph, deps go downwards or use arrows `<-`

          main
          /   \
        ark <- ui ----> bindings, ui_config
          \   /
          buffer
          /   \
       line <- span
          \   /
          llist

where ark -> ui is used only for dispatcing of keypresses (via bindings)
and span -> line is due to span referring to lines via positions
