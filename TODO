features:
	selection
		- create a span struct (see Line in Buffer.h for an example)
		- add system for tying spans to styles (colours, text styles, maybe fonts, etc.)
		- make the magic happen (modify ui drawing loop)
	ui mouse select
	should be able to create new files
    see dwm CLEANMASK for how to remove things like numlock and scrolllock (as we dont want them affecting bindings)

technical debt:
	line wrap - currently cursor and line go off screen.
	drawing loop, char by char - could instead cache up into a larger string and then draw this
	maintaining buf->end on backspace (across lines)
	cursor movement off screen should adjust visible sections - cursor should always be on screen
	bindings now (after new input handling) has to take shift into account twice, once in mods (|SHIFT) and once in key (XK_Q instead of XK_q) (NB: there is always 32 difference between UC nad LC, could check for ShiftMask in mods and check value of keys, and silently convert)
	LINESIZE is declared in line.c and buffer.c, should only be in line.c (make a line_insert function)
	make errors more descriptive, perror + snprintf should be sufficient
	shouldn't have specific rules in Makefile for making .def.h to .h, instead can make one conversion rule (see .c=.o)
	include mess, should have a clear heirachy for deps (should .h files be allowed to include other .h files?)

consider:
	see tour.golang.org for a nice editor, when pasting the text is set to have the same indentation as the surrounding code.
	'highest vo' see how vim does moving by line, it will return to vo even if we visit a line with len < vo before it
	'matching bracket'
	'matching scope' (show the brackets that encloses your current scope)
	inserting line above/below current and positioning cursor there (sublime uses C+enter and C+S+enter)
