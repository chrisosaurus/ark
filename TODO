features:
	ui mouse select
	complex cursor movement (proper moving down of lines, jump by word, etc. )

technical debt:
	drawing loop, char by char
	backspace across lines

consider:
	scrolling in buttonpress, could move elsewhere
	see tour.golang.org for a nice editor, when pasting the text is set to have the same indentation as the surrounding code.
