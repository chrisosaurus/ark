features:
	ui text box (from llist)
	ui keypress -> llist insert
	ui mouse cursor placement
	ui mouse select
	llist delete

technical debt:
	NONE!

consider:
	relationship between llist and ui/ark, both need to 'see' the llist.
		both can modify it (ui handles key presses, could pass off to ark)
		ui needs to be able to draw it (and only it knows when to draw)
		ark needs to be able to modify it
		llist needs to be able to save it
