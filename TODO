features:
	selection
	ui mouse select

technical debt:
	opening a file that doesn't exist (new or mistake) should be handled gracefully (rather than blank window opening and error on STDERR)
	line wrap - currently cursor and line go off screen.
	drawing loop, char by char
	maintaining buf->end on backspace (across lines)
	cursor movement off screen should adjust visible sections - cursor should always be on screen
	bindings now (after new input handling) has to take shift into account twice, once in mods (|SHIFT) and once in key (XK_Q instead of XK_q) (NB: there is always 32 difference between UC nad LC, could check for ShiftMask in mods and check value of keys, and silently convert)

consider:
	see tour.golang.org for a nice editor, when pasting the text is set to have the same indentation as the surrounding code.
	'highest vo' see how vim does moving by line, it will return to vo even if we visit a line with len < vo before it
	'matching bracket'
	'matching scope' (show the brackets that encloses your current scope)
	inserting line above/below current and positioning cursor there (sublime uses C+enter and C+S+enter)

bugs:
	opening a terminal over (monocle mode) and then closing the term (ctrl-d) causes a blank window to be drawn, win-k twice fixes this
